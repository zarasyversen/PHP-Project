# PHP-Project - Learning Project

This is a project I have worked on in my spare time with my mentor. It has been an amazing learning experience. I am now building the FE application in React, [visit the repo](https://github.com/zarasyversen/react-forum).

## Phase 1:
- SQL (Queries, creating tables, date entries)
- Retreving and inserting data in a database. 
- PHP templates
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pages
- User Authentication
- Sessions 
- Image Upload

All functionality was complete but I had all the logic in one file. 
You can see the repo at that stage here: [Phase 1](https://github.com/zarasyversen/PHP-Project/tree/phase1).

## Phase 2: 
- Business Logic and Object Oriented Programming
- Autoloader 
- Models and Repositories. 
- Expections 
- Routing
- Controllers
- Middleware & Interfaces 
- API

This is where I am at now ,isn't it a beaut compared to phase 1! [See repo](https://github.com/zarasyversen/PHP-Project/tree/master).
